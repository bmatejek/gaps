skeletonview -v prefix -affinities [affinity_filename] [affinity_dataset] -gold [gold_filename] [gold_dataset] -image [image_filename] [image_dataset] -segmentation [segmentation_filename] [segmentation_dataset] -scaling [xscale yscale zscale] -closest [nclosest] -max_distance [max_distance] 

skeletons are assumed to be in ./skeletons/$(prefix)/tree_%0d.swc for all seg_ids

defaults:
	scaling = [1, 1, 5] (good for ac3, ac4)
	closest = 7
	max_distance = 100


Alternatively:

skeletonview -v prefix

IF:
	affinities are in affinities/$(prefix)_affinities.h5 ['main']
	human labels are in gold/$(prefix)_gold.h5 ['stack']
	images are in images/$(prefix)_image.h5 ['main']
	segmentation is in segmentations/$(prefix)_machine_labels_seg_28000.h5 ['main']

if any of these locations is wrong you can override these default locations with the above flags. e.g:

skeletonview -v train -segmentation neuroproof/train_segmentation.h5 main


2D Instructions
	Keyboard:
		UP_ARROW - show next slice in stack (z = z + 1) (starts at 0)
		DOWN_ARROW - show previous slice in stack (z = z - 1) (starts at 0)

		'A'/'a' - show affinities
		'C'/'c' - toggle grayscale versus color (default = grayscale)
		'G'/'g' - show gold (human labels) (default)
		'I'/'i' - show raw image
		'S'/'s' - show segmentation
	Mouse:
		Hold left button to show value of slice at that location (if location shown is wrong move mouse slightly - bug)

3D Instructions
	Keyboard:
		UP_ARROW - show next slice in stack (z = z + 1) (starts at 0)
		DOWN_ARROW - show previous slice in stack (z = z - 1) (starts at 0)
		LEFT_ARROW - show previous skeleton pair merge example (starts at 0)
		RIGHT ARROW - show next skeleton pair merge example (starts at 0)

		'A'/'a' - show affinities (when viewing slices is activated in 3D)
		'B'/'b' - toggle bounding box encompassing entire volume (default = on)
		'E'/'e' - toggle show possible merge pairs after skeleton pruning vs. individual segments with false splits (default = on)
		'G'/'g' - show gold (when viewing slices is activated in 3D)
		'I'/'i' - show raw image (when viewing slices is activated in 3D) (default)
		'K'/'k' - toggle showing white skeletons in the 3D point clouds (default = on)
		'M'/'m' - toggle only show merge pairs that were falsely split (default = off)
		'S'/'s' - show segmentation (when viewing slices is activated in 3D)
		'W'/'w' - toggle activation of slice viewing in 3D (default = off)
	Mouse: 
		Hold left button and move to rotate viewer
		Hold middle button and move to zoom in/out viewer

Instructions for both 2D and 3D
	Keyboard:
		'1' - show the X affinities when show_affinities is on (default)
		'2' - show the Y affinities when show_affinities is on 
		'3' - show the Z affinities when show_affinities is on
		'X'/'x' - show yz slices
		'Y'/'y' - show xz slices
		'Z'/'z' - show xy slices (default)
		ENTER - Toggle 2D/3D view
		ESCAPE - Quit viewer

When showing merge candidates is on (use 'E'/'e' to toggle):
	Red/Yellow should not merge
	Blue/Green should merge

When showing merge candidates is off (use 'E'/'e' to toggle):
	Blue is selected segment
	Green are segments that should be merge
